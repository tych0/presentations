These are slides for various talks I've given at various conferences. For the
most part, they're using reveal.js; to see a presentation locally, do
something like:

    git clone https://github.com/tych0/presentations
    cd presentations && make
    cd lca2015 # or the one you're interested in
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    # open a browser to localhost:8000
