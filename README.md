These are slides for various talks I've given at various conferences. For the
most part, they're using reveal.js; to see a presentation locally, do
something like:

    git clone https://github.com/tych0/presentations
    cd presentations && make
    cd lca2015 # or the one you're interested in
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    # open a browser to localhost:8000

I also mirror these on [slides.tycho.ws](http://slides.tycho.ws), so if you
just want to see them in action you can simply go there and select the
presentation you want.
